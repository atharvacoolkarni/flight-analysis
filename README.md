# Project Overview
---
This project explores **flight data analysis and prediction patterns**.  
The main goals were:
- Analyze flight delay patterns and identify key factors 
- Visualize air traffic trends and seasonal patterns
- Predict flight delays using machine learning models 

The analysis is based on commercial flight data and combines statistical analysis and machine learning to obtain meaningful insights.

This project was done for University of London's third year course 'Programming for Data Science' during my BSc. Economics degree. The full coursework question set can be found here <a href="/flight-analysis/st2195_coursework.pdf" target="_blank">ST2195_Coursework (PDF)</a>.

The questions are:
1. When is the 
    1. best time of day to fly to minimise delays?
    1. day of the week to fly to minimise delays?
    1. time of year to fly to minimise delays?
1. Do older planes suffer more delays?
1. How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
1. Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others?
1. Use the available variables to construct a model that predicts delays.
